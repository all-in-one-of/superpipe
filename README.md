Be sure you have Python 3.5 installed, and just run "Main.py" by double clicking on it.

If you don't want the terminal to pop up, you can rename "Main.py" to "Main.pyw".

You can add the shelf to maya by adding the file "maya_scripts/shelf_Superpipe.mel" to your "MyDocuments/maya/20**/prefs/shelves/"" folder. That will add some preview of your shots in Superpipe.

It works only with Maya at the moment.

The ".ma" files in the "src" folder can be modified if you want a different default file as you create a new asset or shot in Superpipe.
